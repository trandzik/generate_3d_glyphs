# Generate 3D glyphs HDA
Rendering complex 3D texts (with bevelling and character offset) in real-time might be a problem in case you are using a framework that lacks these features. However you can use Houdini to pre-generate 3D glyphs, save them to disk with some useful data and then load them on demand in real-time application.
